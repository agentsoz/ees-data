### GOR Behaviour Workshop | 28 Jun 2018

* Jim: doesn't have to be too hot (late 20s) to be a problem for fires; people not as concerned; evac can still be chaotic.

* Jim: sounds (helicopters, sirens) also influence people other than seeing things.

* Jim: *abondoned cars can cause traffic problems.* Callum to see if there is info on number of accidents. Might need focussed accident areas (on pinch points) and also randomly generated ones in smoke front.  

* Inverse law of radiation useful for how far back from the fire front must one be to be "safe" say in a last resort oval.

* Rafael, Jim: lots of indicators around for calculating damage based on distance to fire, radiation, etc.

* Highest cause of death are (1) hyperthermia into 40degrees (2) congested airways (3) accidents.

* Last resort should include "back home".

* Day visitors: should we include foreign visitors; Trev: some are determined to do sightseeing because they have one day that they have planned for ages and they do not want to turn back disappointed.

* `Stay (Home)`, `Shelter (Last resort)` might be another state (intent) to report against.

* Max three attempts to reroute, and probability decreases with each.

* A small percentage of people will drive towards smoke to see what is going on.

* `Going to shops` not part of activities, just going to check on dependents is enough.

* Add to percepts: awareness of weather, like "code red".

* People not in the area might not perceive the threat at all, but their house might be in danger. They would typically in real life get a phone call. This is where Chaminda's work comes in handy.

* Smoke -> Fire -> Neighbours-leaving in terms of ranking; message from EM with different ratings -> message from friend; weather; give points for each percept then react when threshold is breached.   

* Each individual should have probabilistic threshold to percepts.  

* In terms of differences in behaviours between subgroups:
    * Permanent+Part-time Residents: more likely to be aware of danger and plan; most will have a plan to leave; not require too many cues or delay too much; some will be elsewhere and come home; those close to interface to fire are more likely to be prepared; most people that stay are staying to defend not because they think they will be safe;
    * Part-time resident:? Trev.
    * Regular Visitor: will defend with low probability only. Diff from resident in terms of where they go: less likely to go to place of congregation; more likely to go home;
    * Day+Overnight visitors to incorporate ones who are determined to sightsee.
