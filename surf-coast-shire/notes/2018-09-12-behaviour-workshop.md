* Parked cars at destinations such as neighbourhood safe places, do not take up space (in the model), but in reality they can be a significant problem. Can we fix this in MATSim, for instance, do we need to separate out people from vehicles?

* Invac place should have some notion of capacities (Trev). (1) Possibly dynamically change link speeds in a radius near activity location as it gets closer to capacity; or (2) let vehicles disappear into the activity location as they do now, but at the end of simulation report on invac locations as filled to x% of capacity where x can be greater than 100% too (indicating a problem).

* Pete to send vic road counts and Joel to see how we can take that into account when building the transient population.

* Also try and come up with a realistic "typical week day"

* Joel to talk to Pete about how people are getting allocated to locations.
