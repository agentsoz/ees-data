## Human  Behaviour workshop
** 22 May 2018, EMV @ 1030 **

* Jim: Bushfire CRC and then Natural Hazards CRC
* We know that some people will not evacuate; data is consistent across US, Canada, Australia; typically where livelihood is at stake;
* Action: need to know how many will stay and therefore *what will they do wrt traffic*;
* A lot of residents will come home (high number like 80%); majority of those who came back then left.
* Rafeal: messages over time will impact their decisions to stay or go
* Jim: on proximity to fire and whether it impacts the decision; *probably put it in*.
* Jim: on forecast people who will leave are **(a) elderly (b) people with children and (c) who have had a previous bad experience**; also (d) those who have a easy place to go to will be more likely to leave
* Most people who "wait and see" will likely leave either when someone tells them to or when things start to go bad;
* Of those who decide to stay how many will contribute to traffic once they come back home? Not many (Jim)
* Most will stay within 1km of their house
* In-evac (last resort) places of last resort will be places that are cleared like fields, ovals, parking lots; although some will get lost in smoke; some people have a notion of "safe place" for their family where they might go;
* Inverse law of radiation is our friend (Jim)
* People will not just react to a message, they tend to want to seek more information, which adds to the delay
* In terms of time-based reaction:
 1. Smoke first raises the level of concern
 1. Seeing flames is likely to trigger a reaction
 1. Neighbours leaving has a strong influence on people leaving
 1. Messaging and their sequence will add to this
* For messaging: positives include many messages with updated info personalised to me; negatives include *warning fatigue*.
* Demographics matter for reaction to messaging (elderly males don't leave)
* All available cars get used by households.
* Power loss and mobile phone towers loss
* Summary: 80/20 rule applies; 20% of the population causes 80% of the problems; context is everything; have lots of places of last resort


* Much of this applies to residents right, so what of regular visitors and tourists? Visitors were over represented in fatalaties; were not aware; and made bad decisions; holiday homes b&b people tend to follow the instructions of owners or person in charge; halls gap study gives some info on intentions.

* On behaviour of people on the road? * On other risk taking behaviour? If people are stuck, they get out of the cars and run.

* Have in-evac options defined for when other options are infeasible;

* How likely are accidents? Very likely in smoke; accidents tend to completely block roads;

* On panic level? Anxiety/stress degrades performance; driving performance becomes sub-optimal; forgetfulness; poor decisions - take first thing that comes to mind; tunnel vision; better to use the word "anxiety".

* On shadow evacuation? Yes.

* On people coming back once the fire is through? Come back typically due to concern for animals; is a very big issue/concern for people; ~ <5% (check) come back after 2-3 hours; people want to come back! roads blocks are often not an obstacle;

* On spread of information? Not a lot other than face-to-face information spread on road blocks;

* On classes of people? Elderly; Parents (school days; weekends; school holidays when both parents working) People with horses; Across tourist groups too?
